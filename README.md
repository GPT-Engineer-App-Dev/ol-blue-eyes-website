# ol-blue-eyes-website

Create a stylish home page for Frank Sinatra's personal website with the following elements:

- A large hero section with a classic portrait photo of Frank Sinatra and a title like "The Voice of the Century"
- A brief biographical section highlighting his early life, rise to fame, and biggest accomplishments 
- Navigation menu linking to other planned pages: Discography, Photos, Timeline, Contact
- Footer with copyright info and social media links
- Classy color scheme reminiscent of the 1950s/60s, perhaps navy and gold

For the content, write a concise bio focused on his musical career and cultural impact, but use short placeholder text for now as I don't have all the details. The goal is to establish the overall look and feel of the site.
